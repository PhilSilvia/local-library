# Local Library Management

An online database for managing a local library's collection of books. 

# Features

Allows users to view books, genres, and authors based on their:
* Popularity (how often they've been checked out)
* Frequency (how many books written by that author or within that genre)

Keeps track of whether a book is currently checked out or if it is available and maintains a record of who has checked out a particular book. 

# Future Additions

* Add forms that allow the signup for new users
* Add permissions to the users to distinguish between visitors to the library and the librarians
* Add forms that allow new books to be entered into the library by the librarian users

# Technology

The interface is primarily created using HTML and CSS while the backend code is Javascript.
